  [33X[0;0Ysymchm  is  a  GAP  package  that  for projeting polyhedra using Convex Hull
  Method  (chm).  The  'sym'  prefix  follows  from  the fact that symchm also
  supports  specifying  a  group  of  symmetries of the projection polyhedron.
  Currently,  the  main  supported  class of symmetries is the permutations of
  co-ordinate  dimensions  under  which  the  projection  is known to be fixed
  (stabilized  setwise).  The  algorithm  CHM  proceeds by solving a series of
  linear  programs  (LPs)  over  the  input polytope [23XP[123X, recovering a vertex of
  projection  per LP solved. It also maintains an inequality description of an
  inner  bound of projection, associated with the convex hull of the subset of
  vertices  found.  This  description  is  updated  every time a new vertex is
  found.  symchm  exploits  symmetry in several different ways viz. by solving
  roughly  the  number of LPs equal to the number orbits of the symmetry group
  on  vertices  of projection and by using symmetric updates of the inequality
  description.  The  aforementioned  LPs  are  solved  by  an external program
  Qsopt[23X\_[123Xex  [ACDE09]  which is a linear program solver by Applegate,Cook,Dash
  and      Espinoza.      symchm      uses      GAP      interface     package
