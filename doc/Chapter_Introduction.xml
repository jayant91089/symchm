symchm is a GAP package that for projeting polyhedra using Convex Hull Method (chm). The 'sym' prefix follows from the fact that symchm also supports specifying a group of
symmetries of the projection polyhedron. Currently, the main supported class of symmetries is the permutations of co-ordinate dimensions under which the projection is
known to be fixed (stabilized setwise). The algorithm CHM proceeds by solving a series of linear programs (LPs)
over the input polytope <Math>P</Math>, recovering a vertex of projection per LP solved. It also maintains an inequality description of
an inner bound of projection, associated with the convex hull of the subset of vertices found. This description is updated every time a new vertex is found.
symchm exploits symmetry in several different ways viz. by solving roughly the number of LPs equal to the number orbits of the symmetry group on vertices of projection and
by using symmetric updates of the inequality description. The aforementioned LPs are solved by an external program
Qsopt<Math>\_</Math>ex <Cite Key="qs"/> which is a linear program solver
by Applegate,Cook,Dash and Espinoza. symchm uses GAP interface package <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> <Cite Key="jayantqsint"/> to talk to
Qsopt<Math>\_</Math>ex via standard input-output.
