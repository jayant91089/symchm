  ##  PackageInfo.g for the package `symchm'           Jayant Apte
  ##
  ##  This is a GAP readable file. Of course you can change and remove all
  ##  comments as you like.
  ##
  ##  This file contains meta-information on the package. It is used by
  ##  the package loading mechanism and the upgrade mechanism for the
  ##  redistribution of the package via the GAP website.
  ##
  ##  Entries that are commented out are based on the EDIM package and
  ##  are there for purposes of illustration of a possible alternative,
  ##  especially in the case where the Example package's entry is blank.
  ##
  ##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.5 the minimal set of needed
  ##  entries is .PackageName, .Version, and .AvailabilityTest, and an error
  ##  will occur if any of them is missing. Other important entries are
  ##  .PackageDoc and .Dependencies. The other entries are relevant if the
  ##  package will be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
  ##  will be redistributed via the GAP Website.
  ##
  ##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date
  ##  and .ArchiveURL must be updated.

  ##  you must provide a new version number even after small changes.
  Version := "1.0",
  ##  Release date of the current version in dd/mm/yyyy format.
  ##
  Date := "05/11/2016",

  ##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
  ##  the format extension(s), like '.tar.gz' or '-win.zip', which are given next.
  ##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
  ##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
  ##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
  ##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
  ##  example/init.g, ...    or example-3.3/init.g, ...  )

  ##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
  ##  space or commas.
  ##  Currently recognized formats are:
  ##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
  ##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
  ##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS
  ##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
  ##
  ##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
  ##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.

  ##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
  ##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
  ##  contained in each package:
  ##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
  ##       content and installation instructions.
  ##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
  ##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate
  ##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
  ##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
